# Neural Language Model Milestones
This repository contains datapoints of time interval between 1986-2022 of prominent milestones in the evolusion of Neural Language Models describing, in particular, their corresponding training size. This dataset is aimed to help understand and possibly predict the trajectory of dataset size in the near future.

To run the code make sure you install python (I've used python 3.9), (create an virtual env - optional) and run the requirements.txt file.
